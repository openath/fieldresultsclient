This is a demonstration of how we can display field event results, live, so that spectators can follow the action. We're "replaying" a competition in a loop for demo purposes. For an event in progress, an official with a phone or tablet would input the throws, and anyone watching - parents and friends at trackside, or anywhere in the world - can follow the state of the match easily.

##### Server.js (very basic):
> Nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/)

> **Node modules:**

> express (npm install express) // will be removed soon as no longer a requirement.

> socket.io (npm install socket.io) // Handles websocket broadcasts.
  
##### index.html:
> This now does not need to be served from node server and can be loaded independantly from non-ssl servers.
